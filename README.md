The root of trust for my Github user profile

## Gitverify

Currently this is only used for my gitverify.json config file. This is used to verify repositories using [gitverify](https://github.com/supply-chain-tools/gitverify)
Not all my repos are currently supported for verification using gitverify, these are the ones that are:

- root-of-trust
- nix-config
- Hello-World
